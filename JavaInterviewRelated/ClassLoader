Absolutely, Prashant. Since this was the one question you skipped earlier, let me now explain **Class Loaders in Java** in a way that’s interview-ready and backend-engineer focused.

### 🧠 **What is a ClassLoader in Java?**

In Java, a **ClassLoader** is a part of the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is responsible for **loading `.class` files into memory** when they're required for execution.

Think of it as the mechanism through which **Java classes are discovered and brought into memory** during program execution.

---

### 📚 **Why Do We Need Class Loaders?**

* Java loads classes **lazily**, i.e., only when they're first referenced.
* This allows efficient memory usage and dynamic extensibility (like loading plugins at runtime).

---

### 🧱 **Types of Class Loaders**

Java has a **hierarchical delegation model** (parent-first approach). The three primary built-in class loaders are:

| ClassLoader                                                | Loads                                      | Example Classes                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bootstrap ClassLoader**                                  | Core Java classes                          | `java.lang.*`, `java.util.*`          |
| **Extension ClassLoader (PlatformClassLoader in Java 9+)** | Extension libraries (`$JAVA_HOME/lib/ext`) | Cryptography, XML Parsers             |
| **Application ClassLoader (SystemClassLoader)**            | Classes from the classpath                 | Your project’s classes, external JARs |

---

### 🔄 **Delegation Model (Parent-First)**

When a class is requested:

1. It first delegates the request to its **parent** class loader.
2. Only if the parent **cannot find it**, the current loader tries to load it.

This avoids **class duplication/conflicts** between core Java and user-defined classes.

---

### 🧩 **Custom ClassLoaders**

You can create your **own ClassLoader** by extending `ClassLoader` to:

* Load classes from **network**, **encrypted JARs**, **databases**, or **plugins**.
* Achieve **hot reloading** (common in app servers or IDEs).

Example:

```java
public class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    @Override
    protected Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        // Load class bytes from file or network
        byte[] b = loadClassFromSource(name);
        return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
    }
}
```

### 🛠️ **When Backend Engineers Need to Know This**

| Use Case                                | Relevance                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application servers (Tomcat, Jetty)** | Each web app gets its own class loader for isolation                 |
| **Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate**   | Dynamically load classes using reflection + ClassLoaders             |
| **JVM tuning/debugging**                | ClassLoader leaks can cause memory leaks (esp. in long-running apps) |
| **Plugin systems**                      | Custom ClassLoaders allow loading/unloading plugins at runtime       |

### ⚠️ **Common Interview Trick Question**

> Can two classes with the same fully qualified name exist in the same JVM?

✅ **Yes**, if they’re loaded by **different class loaders**.
This is useful for **multi-tenant apps**, **sandboxing**, and **hot deployment**.

---

### ✅ Summary

* **ClassLoaders** bring `.class` files into memory.
* Follows a **parent delegation model**.
* You mostly work with `ApplicationClassLoader`, but knowing the internals helps with advanced problems.
* **Custom ClassLoaders** allow dynamic loading, isolation, and reloading of Java classes — powerful in backend systems.
