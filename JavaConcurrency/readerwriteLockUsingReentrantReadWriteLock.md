Reader-Writer Locks are a concurrency control mechanism used when you have:

Multiple reader threads (that only read data)

Fewer writer threads (that modify data)

The key benefit:

Multiple readers can read concurrently, as long as no writer is writing.

Writers need exclusive access (block both readers and writers).

ğŸ”’ Why Reader-Writer Locks?
Traditional locks (like synchronized or ReentrantLock) block all threads (readers and writers) once acquired. This can lead to unnecessary blocking when multiple readers only need shared access without modification.

Reader-Writer locks optimize this by distinguishing:

Read Lock â€“ allows concurrent access to multiple readers.

Write Lock â€“ exclusive access to a single writer.
